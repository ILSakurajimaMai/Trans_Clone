# CSV Translator Optimization Changelog

## Version 2.0 - Major Refactoring (2025-10-31)

### Overview
This update includes comprehensive optimizations and new features based on user requirements, focusing on improved UX, modular architecture, and enhanced context management.

### Major Changes

#### 1. **New Tabbed Interface**
- **Main Workspace Tab**: CSV editing and translation workspace
- **API Configuration Tab**: Manage API services and keys without interrupting workflow
- **System Instructions Tab**: Edit translation and summary instructions with template management
- **Summary Tab**: Generate and manage content summaries (max 3 history entries)

**Benefits**:
- No longer forced to enter API keys at startup
- Better organization of features
- Non-intrusive configuration management

#### 2. **Enhanced API Management** (`ui/components/api_config_panel.py`)
- Visual management of API services
- Support for custom API endpoints
- Secure API key storage with encryption
- Test connection functionality
- Support for multiple AI providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Custom)

**Key Features**:
- Add/edit/remove custom API services
- Configure endpoint URLs, authentication, and parameters
- Visual indication of API key status
- Test API connections before use

#### 3. **System Instruction Management** (`ui/components/instruction_panel.py`)
- Separate instructions for translation and summary
- Template system for reusable instructions
- Load/save templates
- Default templates based on visual novel translation best practices

**Key Features**:
- Translation instruction editor
- Summary instruction editor
- Template management (add/edit/delete)
- Default templates included

#### 4. **Improved Summary Feature** (`ui/components/summary_panel.py`)
- Complete rebuild of summary functionality
- History management (max 3 summaries, auto-removes oldest)
- Visual history browser
- Context file selection
- Export summaries to text files

**Key Features**:
- Generate summaries with custom system instructions
- Select context files for better understanding
- View summary history with metadata (timestamp, model, tokens)
- Export summaries for documentation

#### 5. **Context File Selection** (`ui/dialogs.py`)
- New dialog for selecting files to use as context
- Configuration options for context generation
- Support for multiple file selection
- Context settings:
  - Source column selection
  - Translation column selection
  - Chunk size configuration
  - Max context chunks limit
  - Filter to only translated rows

#### 6. **Selective Row Translation**
- Right-click context menu on table
- "Translate Selected Rows" with two modes:
  - **Without Context**: Quick translation of selected rows
  - **With Context**: Translation using context from other files

**Benefits**:
- Translate specific rows without full file processing
- Context-aware translation for better quality
- Flexible workflow

#### 7. **Context Management Integration**
- Existing `ContextManager` is now fully integrated
- Support for building context from (original, translation) pairs
- Chunk-based context to avoid token limits
- File-level context configuration

### Technical Improvements

#### Code Organization
```

├── components/
│   ├── api_config_panel.py      # NEW: API management
│   ├── instruction_panel.py     # NEW: System instructions
│   ├── summary_panel.py         # NEW: Summary feature
│   ├── action_panel.py          # Existing
│   └── config_panel.py          # Existing
├── dialogs.py                   # UPDATED: Added ContextFileSelectionDialog
└── main_window.py               # MAJOR UPDATE: Tabbed interface
```

#### Key Architecture Changes

1. **Tabbed Interface**:
   - `QTabWidget` for main navigation
   - Separate tabs for different concerns
   - Better separation of features

2. **API Configuration**:
   - No startup interruption
   - Visual service management
   - Encrypted key storage (using `cryptography.fernet`)

3. **System Instructions**:
   - Template-based approach
   - Reusable configurations
   - Easy customization

4. **Context Management**:
   - File selection dialog
   - Configurable context building
   - Chunk-based approach for large datasets

### Backward Compatibility

- Project files (.csvtproj) remain compatible
- Existing translation history is preserved
- API key migration is automatic
- Old config settings are maintained

### Migration Notes

#### For Users:
1. On first launch, go to "API Configuration" tab to set up API keys
2. Configure system instructions in "System Instructions" tab (defaults are provided)
3. Use right-click menu on table for selective translation
4. Summary feature moved to dedicated tab

#### For Developers:
1. New components in `ui/components/`:
   - `APIConfigPanel`: API service management
   - `InstructionPanel`: System instruction editor
   - `SummaryPanel`: Summary feature
2. Updated `main_window.py` with tabbed interface
3. Added `ContextFileSelectionDialog` in `dialogs.py`

### Benefits Summary

1. **Better UX**:
   - No forced API key entry at startup
   - Organized tabs for different features
   - Context menus for quick actions

2. **More Flexible**:
   - Custom API endpoints
   - Reusable instruction templates
   - Selective row translation

3. **Better Context Management**:
   - Choose which files provide context
   - Configure context parameters
   - Visual feedback on context usage

4. **Enhanced Summary**:
   - Dedicated summary tab
   - History management
   - Custom instructions
   - Export functionality

### Known Limitations & Future Work

1. **TODO**: Implement actual summary generation with API integration
2. **TODO**: Implement selective row translation with context
3. **TODO**: Add progress indicators for long-running operations
4. **TODO**: Add validation for custom API endpoints
5. **TODO**: Add more instruction templates

### Testing

To test the new features:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install PyQt6 pandas langchain langgraph langchain-google-genai cryptography requests

# Run application
python main.py
```

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Application starts without API key prompt
- [ ] All 4 tabs are visible and functional
- [ ] API Configuration tab can add/edit/remove services
- [ ] System Instructions tab can edit and save templates
- [ ] Summary tab displays properly
- [ ] Right-click on table shows "Translate Selected Rows" menu
- [ ] Context file selection dialog works
- [ ] Project save/load preserves new settings

### Credits

This optimization was designed to improve workflow efficiency and make the tool more user-friendly, especially for professional translation projects. Inspired by features from Translator++ and user feedback.

### Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial release with basic translation features
- **v2.0**: Major refactoring with tabbed interface, API management, context support, and enhanced summary feature
